# Research: Advanced Cache Strategies and Enterprise Features

**Date**: 2025-01-22
**Feature**: Advanced Cache Strategies and Enterprise Features
**Phase**: 0 - Research & Technical Decisions

## Research Areas

### 1. Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC) Algorithm

**Decision**: Implement IBM's ARC algorithm with dual LRU lists (T1/T2) and ghost lists (B1/B2)

**Rationale**:
- ARC automatically balances between recency (LRU) and frequency (LFU) without manual tuning
- Proven to outperform static algorithms in mixed workloads by 10-20%
- Self-adapting parameters based on workload patterns
- Patent-free implementation possible using published algorithm details

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Window-TinyLFU: More complex probabilistic approach, requires Bloom filters
- Multi-Queue (MQ): Good performance but more memory overhead
- CAR (Clock with Adaptive Replacement): Simpler but less effective than ARC

**Implementation Approach**:
- Four lists: T1 (recent), T2 (frequent), B1 (ghost recent), B2 (ghost frequent)
- Adaptive parameter `p` that balances between T1 and T2 sizes
- Cache replacement based on hit patterns in ghost lists

### 2. Hierarchical Multi-Level Caching

**Decision**: Implement L1 (Memory) → L2 (Redis) → L3 (S3/Azure/GCS) with cost-aware promotion

**Rationale**:
- Memory provides fastest access (μs), Redis medium speed (ms), cloud storage cost-effective (100ms)
- Automatic data movement based on access frequency and cost optimization
- Supports enterprise scale-out scenarios with different performance/cost tiers

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Two-tier only (Memory + Redis): Limited cost optimization for cold data
- Local SSD as L2: Not suitable for distributed deployments
- Database as L3: More complex than object storage APIs

**Implementation Approach**:
- Abstract TierManager with promotion/demotion policies
- Access frequency tracking with exponential decay
- Cost models for different storage tiers
- Async background data movement

### 3. ML-Powered Predictive Prefetching

**Decision**: Use lightweight time-series forecasting with scikit-learn initially, upgrade to PyTorch for complex patterns

**Rationale**:
- Start with simple ARIMA/exponential smoothing for predictable patterns
- Sequence-to-sequence models (LSTM/Transformer) for complex access patterns
- Online learning to adapt to changing workloads
- 30-50% miss reduction achievable based on research literature

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Rule-based prefetching: Too simple for complex patterns
- Full deep learning from start: Over-engineering for many workloads
- External ML service: Adds latency and complexity

**Implementation Approach**:
- Access pattern collector with time windows
- Feature engineering: access frequency, temporal patterns, user context
- Model training pipeline with A/B testing framework
- Confidence-based prefetching with adaptive thresholds

### 4. Zero-Trust Security and Encryption

**Decision**: Use AES-256-GCM for encryption, spaCy/regex for PII detection, envelope encryption for keys

**Rationale**:
- AES-256-GCM provides authenticated encryption with minimal overhead
- Field-level encryption for sensitive data elements
- Automatic PII detection prevents accidental exposure
- Key rotation without service interruption using envelope encryption

**Alternatives Considered**:
- ChaCha20-Poly1305: Good performance but less hardware acceleration
- End-to-end encryption only: Doesn't protect against internal threats
- External HSM: Too complex for most deployments

**Implementation Approach**:
- Pluggable encryption providers (local, HSM, cloud KMS)
- PII classification engine with configurable rules
- GDPR compliance with data lineage tracking
- Transparent encryption/decryption in cache operations

### 5. Real-Time Analytics Dashboard

**Decision**: Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing, pre-built Grafana dashboards

**Rationale**:
- Prometheus is industry standard for metrics collection
- OpenTelemetry provides vendor-neutral distributed tracing
- Grafana offers rich visualization and alerting capabilities
- Integration with existing monitoring infrastructure

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Custom metrics system: Reinventing the wheel
- Commercial APM tools: Vendor lock-in and cost concerns
- InfluxDB for metrics: Less ecosystem support than Prometheus

**Implementation Approach**:
- Metrics: hit rates, latency percentiles, tier utilization, ML accuracy
- Traces: cache operation flows across tiers
- Custom Grafana dashboards with SLI/SLO tracking
- Intelligent alerting based on anomaly detection

### 6. Event-Driven Cache Invalidation

**Decision**: Support multiple event sources (Kafka, AWS EventBridge, webhook) with dependency graph tracking

**Rationale**:
- Event-driven architecture enables real-time cache consistency
- Dependency graphs prevent cascading inconsistencies
- Multiple source support for different enterprise environments
- Graceful degradation when event streams are unavailable

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Polling-based invalidation: Higher latency and resource usage
- Database triggers only: Limited to database changes
- Single event platform: Reduces flexibility

**Implementation Approach**:
- Pluggable event source adapters
- Dependency graph using directed acyclic graph (DAG)
- Ordered invalidation with retry mechanisms
- Event replay for handling failures

## Technology Integration Points
