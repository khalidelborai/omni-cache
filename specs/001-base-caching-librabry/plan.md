# Implementation Plan: Base Caching Library Architecture

**Branch**: `001-base-caching-librabry` | **Date**: 2025-09-22 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-base-caching-librabry/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Universal caching library providing multiple modern caching strategies (LRU, LFU, TTL-based, size-based), supporting both synchronous and asynchronous operations, with integrated CLI tools for management and FastAPI middleware/decorators for seamless web application integration. The library emphasizes extensibility through plugin architecture and reusability across different project types.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (based on pyproject.toml detection and FastAPI integration requirement)
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, AsyncIO, Click (CLI), Redis (optional backend), sqlite3 (fallback), typing-extensions
**Storage**: Multi-backend support - in-memory (default), Redis, file system, with pluggable interface
**Testing**: pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-benchmark for performance testing
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows) with primary focus on server environments
**Project Type**: single (library with CLI tools)
**Performance Goals**: Sub-millisecond cache operations, 10k+ operations/second, minimal memory overhead
**Constraints**: Thread-safe operations, graceful degradation on backend failures, backward compatibility
**Scale/Scope**: Support from single-process to distributed scenarios, 1M+ cache entries, multi-tenant capable

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Library-First Principle**: ✅ PASS - Building standalone caching library with clear purpose
**CLI Interface**: ✅ PASS - Will provide CLI tools for cache management and inspection
**Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: ✅ PASS - TDD approach planned with contract tests before implementation
**Integration Testing**: ✅ PASS - FastAPI integration and multi-backend scenarios require integration tests
**Observability**: ✅ PASS - Statistics, monitoring, and structured logging planned
**Simplicity**: ✅ PASS - Starting with core caching concepts, extensible architecture follows YAGNI

**Initial Check**: No constitutional violations detected. Proceeding with Phase 0.

**Post-Phase 1 Re-evaluation**:
- **Library-First**: ✅ PASS - Clear separation of core library, CLI tools, and FastAPI integration
- **CLI Interface**: ✅ PASS - Comprehensive CLI commands defined in contracts/cli_commands.yaml
- **Test-First**: ✅ PASS - Contract tests planned for all API endpoints and integration scenarios
- **Integration Testing**: ✅ PASS - FastAPI, Redis, and multi-backend integration scenarios covered
- **Observability**: ✅ PASS - Statistics API and monitoring capabilities detailed in contracts
- **Simplicity**: ✅ PASS - Core abstractions (Cache, Strategy, Backend) remain simple and focused

All constitutional principles maintained after design phase. Ready for Phase 2.

```

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Core entities (Cache, Strategy, Backend, CacheEntry) → model creation tasks [P]
- API contracts → contract test tasks for each endpoint [P]
- CLI commands → command implementation and test tasks [P]
- FastAPI integration → decorator/middleware test and implementation tasks
- Quickstart scenarios → integration test tasks validating user workflows
- Backend implementations → storage backend test and implementation tasks [P]

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **Phase 2a - Foundation**: Core models and abstract interfaces (parallel)
- **Phase 2b - Backends**: Storage backend implementations (parallel)
- **Phase 2c - Strategies**: Eviction strategy implementations (parallel)
- **Phase 2d - Core Library**: Cache engine and operations (sequential)
- **Phase 2e - CLI Tools**: Command-line interface (parallel with integrations)
- **Phase 2f - FastAPI Integration**: Web framework decorators/middleware
- **Phase 2g - Integration Tests**: End-to-end scenario validation
- **Phase 2h - Performance**: Benchmarking and optimization

**Parallelization Strategy**:
- Mark [P] for independent component development
- Strategy implementations can be developed concurrently
- Backend implementations are independent
- CLI commands can be implemented in parallel
- Contract tests can be written concurrently with implementation

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md organized by phases

**Key Dependencies Identified**:
- Core models must complete before cache engine
- At least one backend must complete before integration tests
- Contract tests should fail before implementation begins (TDD)
- QuickStart scenarios drive integration test requirements

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
