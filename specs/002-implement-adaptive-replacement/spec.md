## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a **DevOps engineer** managing high-traffic applications, I need advanced caching capabilities that automatically optimize performance based on real-world usage patterns, provide enterprise-grade security, and offer comprehensive observability so that I can ensure optimal application performance while meeting compliance requirements and reducing operational overhead.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a cache experiencing mixed read patterns, **When** the ARC strategy is enabled, **Then** the system automatically balances between recency and frequency optimization achieving better hit rates than static LRU/LFU strategies
2. **Given** frequently accessed data in memory cache, **When** access patterns change, **Then** the hierarchical system automatically promotes/demotes data between memory, Redis, and cloud storage tiers based on cost-effectiveness
3. **Given** historical access patterns, **When** ML prefetching is enabled, **Then** the system proactively caches data before requests occur, reducing cache misses by at least 30%
4. **Given** cached data containing sensitive information, **When** security features are enabled, **Then** all data is automatically encrypted and PII is detected/masked according to compliance requirements
5. **Given** multiple cache instances in production, **When** accessing the analytics dashboard, **Then** real-time performance metrics, traces, and alerts are available across all cache tiers
6. **Given** data changes in source systems, **When** event-driven invalidation is configured, **Then** dependent cache entries are automatically invalidated in the correct order

### Edge Cases
- What happens when ML prediction models become stale or inaccurate?
- How does the system handle security key rotation without service interruption?
- What occurs when hierarchical tier promotion/demotion conflicts with user-defined policies?
- How does the system behave when event streams are temporarily unavailable?
- What happens when analytics collection impacts cache performance?
