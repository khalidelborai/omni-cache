# Research Phase: Base Caching Library Architecture

**Feature**: Base Caching Library Architecture
**Phase**: 0 - Research & Technology Selection
**Date**: 2025-09-22

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. Python Caching Libraries Ecosystem

**Decision**: Build custom library with inspiration from established patterns
**Rationale**:
- Existing libraries (functools.lru_cache, cachetools, dogpile.cache) have limitations
- functools.lru_cache: Limited to function decoration, no async support, no backend flexibility
- cachetools: Good algorithms but missing FastAPI integration and CLI tools
- dogpile.cache: Complex, heavyweight, not designed for modern async patterns
- Custom solution allows unified architecture supporting all requirements

**Alternatives considered**:
- Extending existing libraries: Would require significant monkey-patching
- Redis-only solution: Too limiting for diverse deployment scenarios
- File-based only: Performance limitations for high-throughput scenarios

### 2. Caching Strategy Implementation Patterns

**Decision**: Strategy pattern with pluggable eviction policies
**Rationale**:
- Allows runtime strategy switching (FR-002)
- Enables custom strategy development (FR-009)
- Separates concerns between storage and eviction logic
- Industry standard approach used by Redis, Memcached

**Alternatives considered**:
- Fixed strategies: Would violate extensibility requirements
- Configuration-only approach: Insufficient flexibility for custom algorithms

### 3. Async/Sync API Design

**Decision**: Dual API with sync wrapper around async core
**Rationale**:
- FastAPI applications are async-first
- Sync compatibility for traditional applications
- Single implementation reduces maintenance burden
- Performance benefits of async I/O for Redis/network backends

**Alternatives considered**:
- Sync-only: Would limit FastAPI integration performance
- Async-only: Would exclude sync applications
- Separate implementations: Higher maintenance cost

### 4. Serialization Strategy

**Decision**: Pluggable serialization with JSON/Pickle defaults
**Rationale**:
- JSON for interoperability and human readability
- Pickle for Python object fidelity
- Custom serializers for performance-critical scenarios
- Type hints for automatic serializer selection

**Alternatives considered**:
- JSON-only: Insufficient for complex Python objects
- Pickle-only: Security concerns and language lock-in
- Protocol Buffers: Overkill for general caching use cases

### 5. CLI Framework Selection

**Decision**: Click framework for CLI implementation
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for Python CLI applications
- Excellent command composition and help generation
- Supports complex command hierarchies
- Good integration with async operations

**Alternatives considered**:
- argparse: Too low-level for complex command structures
- Fire: Less control over command interface design
- Typer: Good alternative but Click has more ecosystem support

### 6. FastAPI Integration Patterns

**Decision**: Decorators + middleware approach
**Rationale**:
- Decorators for function-level caching (common use case)
- Middleware for request-level caching with sophisticated rules
- Follows FastAPI ecosystem conventions
- Enables both declarative and programmatic usage

**Alternatives considered**:
- Middleware-only: Less convenient for simple function caching
- Decorator-only: Insufficient for complex request caching scenarios

### 7. Backend Storage Architecture

**Decision**: Abstract backend interface with multiple implementations
**Rationale**:
- Enables deployment flexibility (memory, Redis, file system)
- Allows graceful degradation when backends unavailable
- Supports different consistency models per backend
- Enables testing with mock backends

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single backend: Too limiting for diverse deployment needs
- Configuration-driven only: Insufficient flexibility for runtime decisions

### 8. Thread Safety and Concurrency

**Decision**: Lock-free algorithms where possible, fine-grained locking elsewhere
**Rationale**:
- High performance under concurrent load
- Avoid deadlock scenarios in complex cache hierarchies
- Support for async contexts without blocking
- Industry best practices from Redis/Memcached

**Alternatives considered**:
- Global locks: Poor performance under load
- No thread safety: Would limit deployment scenarios
- Process-level isolation: Too heavyweight for most use cases

### 9. Performance Monitoring and Observability

**Decision**: Built-in metrics with pluggable exporters
**Rationale**:
- Essential for production cache management
- Supports integration with existing monitoring systems
- Enables performance optimization and capacity planning
- Constitutional requirement for observability

**Alternatives considered**:
- No built-in metrics: Would require external instrumentation
- Single metrics format: Reduces integration flexibility

### 10. Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-layer testing with contract tests, integration tests, and benchmarks
**Rationale**:
- Contract tests ensure backend compatibility
- Integration tests verify FastAPI integration
- Benchmarks ensure performance requirements met
- Supports TDD constitutional requirement

**Alternatives considered**:
- Unit tests only: Insufficient for integration scenarios
- Integration tests only: Would miss component-level issues

## Technology Stack Finalized

**Core Library**: Python 3.11+ with AsyncIO
**CLI Framework**: Click 8.x
**Web Integration**: FastAPI with custom decorators/middleware
**Testing**: pytest + pytest-asyncio + pytest-benchmark
**Backends**: Memory (default), Redis (optional), File system (fallback)
**Serialization**: JSON (default), Pickle (Python objects), Pluggable interface
**Monitoring**: Built-in metrics with Prometheus/StatsD export support

## Architecture Decisions Record

| Decision | Rationale | Trade-offs |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Strategy Pattern for eviction | Extensibility + runtime switching | Slight performance overhead |
| Async-first with sync wrapper | Modern framework compatibility | Additional complexity |
| Multi-backend abstraction | Deployment flexibility | Interface complexity |
| Click for CLI | Ecosystem maturity | Dependency weight |
| Decorator + Middleware FastAPI | Usage flexibility | Multiple integration points |

## Next Phase Requirements

Phase 1 should focus on:
1. Data model design for Cache, Strategy, Key, Value entities
2. API contracts for core caching operations
3. Backend interface contracts
4. CLI command contracts
5. FastAPI integration contracts

All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from Technical Context have been resolved through research.
