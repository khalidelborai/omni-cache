# Tasks: Base Caching Library Architecture

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-base-caching-librabry/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✓), research.md (✓), data-model.md (✓), contracts/ (✓), quickstart.md (✓)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Extract: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, AsyncIO, Click, Redis, pytest
   → Structure: single project (library with CLI tools)
2. Load optional design documents ✓
   → data-model.md: 6 entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: 3 files → contract test tasks
   → quickstart.md: 5 scenarios → integration test tasks
3. Generate tasks by category ✓
   → Setup: project structure, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, strategies, backends, CLI commands
   → Integration: FastAPI integration, monitoring
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, documentation
4. Apply task rules ✓
   → Different files = [P] for parallel execution
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T038) ✓
6. Generate dependency graph ✓
7. Create parallel execution examples ✓
8. Validate task completeness ✓
   → All contracts have tests ✓
   → All entities have models ✓
   → All integration scenarios covered ✓
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution) ✓
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths assume Python library structure per plan.md

## Phase 3.1: Project Setup
- [x] T001 Create project structure with src/ and tests/ directories, configure pyproject.toml with Python 3.11+ and required dependencies (FastAPI, AsyncIO, Click, Redis, pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-benchmark)
- [x] T002 Initialize Python package structure in src/omnicache/ with __init__.py, create basic CLI entry point in src/omnicache/cli/__init__.py
- [x] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools (black, isort, flake8, mypy) with configuration files (.flake8, pyproject.toml sections)

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3

## Task Details

### Critical Path
T001 → T002 → T003 → (T004-T016) → (T017-T022) → T023 → (T024-T026) & T027 → (T028-T031) → (T032-T034) → (T035-T037) & T038

### High Parallelization Phases
- **Contract Tests**: 8 parallel tasks (T004-T011)
- **Integration Tests**: 5 parallel tasks (T012-T016)
- **Core Models**: 6 parallel tasks (T017-T022)
- **Backends**: 3 parallel tasks (T024-T026) after T023
- **Strategies**: 4 parallel tasks (T028-T031) after T027
- **CLI Commands**: 2 parallel tasks (T035-T036)

### Sequential Bottlenecks
- T023 (Backend interface) blocks backend implementations
- T027 (Strategy interface) blocks strategy implementations
- T032-T034 (Core engine) requires models, backends, and strategies
- T037 (CLI main) requires CLI command modules
- T038 (FastAPI integration) requires core engine

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked before task execution*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T004-T011 cover all 3 contract files)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (T017-T022 cover all 6 data model entities)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T004-T016 before T017-T038)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (verified file paths and dependencies)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task

## Performance Targets
Based on plan.md performance goals:
- Sub-millisecond cache operations
- 10k+ operations/second
- Minimal memory overhead
- Thread-safe operations

These will be validated in integration tests and can be benchmarked after T032-T034 completion.

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies between them
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD critical)
- Follow quickstart.md scenarios for integration test validation
- Each backend and strategy should be independently testable
- CLI tools must work without FastAPI dependency
- FastAPI integration must work without CLI dependency
- All components must support both sync and async operations
