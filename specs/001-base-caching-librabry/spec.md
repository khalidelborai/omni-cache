# Feature Specification: Base Caching Library Architecture

**Feature Branch**: `001-base-caching-librabry`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Base caching librabry structure and arch that support all modern caching concepts and stargies and can integrate with cli tools and fastapi and is extendable and reusable"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature parsed: Universal caching library with modern strategies and framework integration
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: developers, CLI users, FastAPI applications
   ’ Actions: cache data, retrieve data, invalidate cache, configure strategies
   ’ Data: cached values, cache keys, metadata, configuration
   ’ Constraints: extensibility, reusability, modern strategies support
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific caching strategies and patterns required]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: performance requirements and scale targets]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data persistence requirements]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary flow: Developer integrates library and configures caching
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement focuses on capability, not implementation
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Cache, Strategy, Key, Value, Configuration
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties about specific strategies and performance"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer wants to add caching capabilities to their application to improve performance. They need a flexible library that supports various caching strategies, can be easily integrated into different frameworks (like FastAPI), and can be managed through CLI tools for operations and monitoring.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new project, **When** developer integrates the caching library, **Then** they can store and retrieve data with minimal configuration
2. **Given** an existing FastAPI application, **When** developer adds caching decorators, **Then** API responses are automatically cached and served
3. **Given** a production system, **When** administrator uses CLI tools, **Then** they can monitor cache performance and clear specific cache entries
4. **Given** changing performance requirements, **When** developer switches caching strategies, **Then** the change requires minimal code modifications
5. **Given** custom caching needs, **When** developer creates new cache strategy, **Then** it integrates seamlessly with existing library architecture

### Edge Cases
- What happens when cache storage reaches capacity limits?
- How does system handle concurrent access to the same cache key?
- What occurs when cache backend becomes unavailable?
- How are cache dependencies managed during invalidation?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide multiple caching strategies (LRU, LFU, TTL-based, size-based)
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow developers to switch between caching strategies without code changes
- **FR-003**: System MUST support cache key namespacing for multi-tenant scenarios
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide cache statistics and monitoring capabilities
- **FR-005**: System MUST support both synchronous and asynchronous operations
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow custom serialization for complex data types
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide cache invalidation mechanisms (single key, pattern-based, tag-based)
- **FR-008**: System MUST support cache warming and preloading capabilities
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow developers to create custom caching strategies through extension points
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide CLI tools for cache management and inspection
- **FR-011**: System MUST integrate with FastAPI through decorators and middleware
- **FR-012**: System MUST support cache hierarchies and multi-level caching
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle cache misses gracefully with configurable fallback behavior
- **FR-014**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific persistence backends - memory, Redis, file system?]
- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain cache consistency across [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: single instance or distributed scenarios?]
- **FR-016**: System MUST achieve [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific performance targets for cache operations]
- **FR-017**: System MUST retain cached data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: default TTL and maximum retention policies]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Cache**: Central storage abstraction that holds key-value pairs with associated metadata
- **Strategy**: Behavior definition for cache operations including eviction, expiration, and storage policies
- **Key**: Unique identifier for cached data with optional namespace and tagging capabilities
- **Value**: Stored data with serialization metadata and access tracking information
- **Configuration**: Settings that define cache behavior, limits, and integration parameters
- **Statistics**: Performance metrics and usage data for monitoring and optimization
