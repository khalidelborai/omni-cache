# Implementation Plan: Advanced Cache Strategies and Enterprise Features

**Branch**: `002-implement-adaptive-replacement` | **Date**: 2025-01-22 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-implement-adaptive-replacement/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This feature implements six advanced caching capabilities for enterprise environments: (1) Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC) strategy that self-tunes between LRU/LFU, (2) Hierarchical multi-level caching with L1→L2→L3 automatic tier management, (3) ML-powered predictive prefetching for 30-50% cache miss reduction, (4) Zero-trust security with PII detection and GDPR compliance, (5) Real-time analytics dashboard with Prometheus/Grafana integration, and (6) Event-driven cache invalidation with dependency tracking. Primary requirement is to provide enterprise-grade caching that automatically optimizes performance, security, and cost without manual intervention.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (existing OmniCache codebase)
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI (existing), Redis, scikit-learn/pytorch (ML), cryptography (encryption), prometheus-client, opentelemetry
**Storage**: Multi-tier: Memory (L1), Redis (L2), Cloud Storage APIs (L3)
**Testing**: pytest (existing framework), asyncio testing
**Target Platform**: Linux server, container deployments
**Project Type**: single (extending existing OmniCache library)
**Performance Goals**: ARC >10% improvement over LRU/LFU, ML prefetching 30-50% miss reduction, <10% security overhead, <5% analytics overhead
**Constraints**: Backward compatibility with existing OmniCache APIs, graceful degradation on failures, enterprise security standards
**Scale/Scope**: Support for high-traffic applications (10k+ ops/sec), enterprise multi-tenant environments, real-time analytics across distributed cache clusters

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Test-First Development**: ✅ PASS - All features will follow TDD with contract tests before implementation
**Library-First Architecture**: ✅ PASS - Extending existing OmniCache library with new strategy/backend modules
**CLI Integration**: ✅ PASS - All new features will be accessible via existing CLI interface
**Backward Compatibility**: ✅ PASS - New strategies/features are additive, existing APIs unchanged
**Observability**: ✅ PASS - Enhanced observability is a core feature requirement
**Simplicity**: ⚠️ REVIEW - Complex feature set with ML/analytics may violate simplicity principle

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Extending existing OmniCache library structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| ML/Analytics complexity | Enterprise requirements for predictive caching and comprehensive observability | Simple caching insufficient for high-traffic enterprise workloads requiring 30-50% miss reduction and real-time monitoring |
| Multiple advanced features | Customer demand for comprehensive enterprise caching solution | Implementing features separately would create integration complexity and inconsistent APIs |
