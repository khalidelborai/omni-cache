# Tasks: Advanced Cache Strategies and Enterprise Features

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-implement-adaptive-replacement/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → ✅ Found: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Redis, ML libraries, encryption
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract 9 entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: 6 API files → contract test tasks
   → research.md: Extract technology decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: dependencies, project structure
   → Tests: 6 contract test suites, integration tests
   → Core: 9 models, 6 strategy/backend implementations
   → Integration: CLI, FastAPI, analytics
   → Polish: unit tests, performance validation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T060)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → ✅ All 6 contracts have tests
   → ✅ All 9 entities have models
   → ✅ All endpoints implemented
9. Return: SUCCESS (60 tasks ready for execution)
```

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 3.2: Contract Tests (all parallel)
```bash
# Launch T004-T009 together - different test files:
Task: "Contract test ARC strategy API in tests/contract/test_arc_strategy_api.py"
Task: "Contract test hierarchical cache API in tests/contract/test_hierarchical_cache_api.py"
Task: "Contract test ML prefetch API in tests/contract/test_ml_prefetch_api.py"
Task: "Contract test security API in tests/contract/test_security_api.py"
Task: "Contract test analytics API in tests/contract/test_analytics_api.py"
Task: "Contract test event invalidation API in tests/contract/test_event_invalidation_api.py"
```

### Phase 3.3: Model Creation (all parallel)
```bash
# Launch T017-T025 together - different model files:
Task: "ARC Strategy entity in src/omnicache/strategies/arc.py"
Task: "Cache Tier entity in src/omnicache/models/tier.py"
Task: "Access Pattern entity in src/omnicache/models/access_pattern.py"
Task: "Security Policy entity in src/omnicache/models/security_policy.py"
Task: "Dependency Graph entity in src/omnicache/models/dependency_graph.py"
# ... continue with remaining models
```

### Phase 3.5: CLI Commands (all parallel)
```bash
# Launch T052-T056 together - different CLI command files:
Task: "ARC strategy CLI commands in src/omnicache/cli/commands/arc.py"
Task: "Hierarchical cache CLI commands in src/omnicache/cli/commands/tiers.py"
Task: "ML prefetching CLI commands in src/omnicache/cli/commands/ml.py"
Task: "Security CLI commands in src/omnicache/cli/commands/security.py"
Task: "Analytics CLI commands in src/omnicache/cli/commands/analytics.py"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies between them
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD principle)
- Each feature area is designed to be mostly independent
- Security and analytics features integrate across all components
- Performance targets: ARC >10% improvement, ML 30-50% miss reduction, <10% security overhead

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Contracts**: 6 contract files → 6 contract test tasks [P] (T004-T009)
2. **From Data Model**: 9 entities → 9 model creation tasks [P] (T017-T025)
3. **From User Stories**: 7 quickstart scenarios → 7 integration tests [P] (T010-T016)
4. **Ordering**: Setup → Tests → Models → Implementations → Integration → Polish
5. **Dependencies**: Properly block parallel execution where needed
